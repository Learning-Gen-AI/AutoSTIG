# AutoSTIG
Using generative AI to convert a US DOD STIG into a series of PS and CMD commands to partially automate computer security audits

main.py is an aborted attempt to have this done running locally. This was not necessary as the STIG is publically available.

I decided to use Claude.ai and it did a better job but only gave 83 commands to 253 checks so the value added was a lot less than I had hoped
